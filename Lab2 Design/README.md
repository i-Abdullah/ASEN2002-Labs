	1- ZeroPressure Ballons are Ballons that maintain the pressure difference between in and out as low as possible, and This's maintained by having an opening at the bottom to allow the extra pressure to escape, this will result in maintaining an equal pressure BUT some air will escape, and thus as air escapes volume goes down. This makes them useful for short time.

ΔF = (ρa −ρg)gV. (2.4)
