# TensileLab

` ASEN 1022-100: Materials Science Aerospace, CU-Boulder, Summer 2018 `

This repo contains all of our work for a lab experiment done by my classmates and I :


##### Geraldine Fuentes
##### Raymie Fotherby
##### Sam Hartman
##### Abdulla Al Ameri

We will be **measuring, and analyzing the failure loads and locations of test specimens made from two types of Aluminum alloys.** Each will be tested in a single specimen configuration for a total of two test specimen cases(1). 

This repo has a MATLAB code to analyze the data we collected and along with the actual dat, and lab instructions.

Our group has been **divided into two groups.** Each group tested two samples of Aluminum alloys, one is brittle and one is ductile. Fotherby, and Fuentes were in the same group, and Al-Ameri and Hartman were on the same group. In MATLAB Script data will be referred to using the *type of Aluminum alloy* used and also the *last names initials* for the group who measured the data being analyzed. The code is divided into sections so it is easier to run it for a desired section.

## Files/Folders

**CollectedData:** Folder that contains the collected data converted to Excel file to be imported to MATLAB easily and converted to .mat file.


**DataMeasurements:** MATLAB Script that will convert collected data into .mat file that has the force applied and elongation data collected. In addition, the .mat file has average measured thickness, and width for each alloy to estimate the cross sectional area. The measures were taken using Electronic Caliper Measuring Tool.

**Group_Brittle/Ductile.mat:** MATLAB files that has all of the data for both groups. Two files per type of alloy.

**TensileLab.m:** The script to analyze the data.
