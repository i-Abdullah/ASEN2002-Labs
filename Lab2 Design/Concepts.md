* Some of the important concepts and how to account for them.

	1- ZeroPressure Ballons are Ballons that maintain the pressure difference between in and out as low as possible, and This's maintained by having an opening at the bottom to allow the extra pressure to escape, this happens via pressure wanna leave from high to low pressure, and thus it escapes. This will result in maintaining an equal pressure BUT some air will escape, however as heating and cooling happens volume will change and thus more heat will escape (the vent or the opening is one way thing), also volume will increase or decrease which will result in change in altitude. This makes them useful for short time. The material can be really thin because it doesn't have to withstand high pressures compared to super pressure ballon

It is partly filled with gas while on the ground, which gives the balloon a teardrop shape. As the balloon ascends, the gas expands and fills the balloon, making it spherical. The balloon has a valve that automatically discharges excess gas when it reaches its predetermined altitude, so it remains in place. When the sun sets and the gas cools, the volume decreases and the balloon descends to the ground.


Thus, not also the change in volume, we must account for change in pressure a bit that will also let some air out AGAIN!

## STUFF THAT WILL CAUSE THE Q to change in and out!

1- Emissivity : How much heat the body emits. It's also called radiation, it's given in units of W/m².

- Black body emissivity (objects emissivity): For Mylar emissivity = 0.044.
- Sun Emissivity: How much power the sun radiates can affect, on AVG earth's top surface is 1361 W/m2
- Sun will vary with Time of the year, and orbits

- WE WILL USE T to find Q.
Q = mcΔT
Q = heat content in Joules
m = mass
c = specific heat, J/g °C
T = temperature
ΔT = change in temperature


2- Albedo is a measure of reflectivity, we'll be 

	- Albedo in Boulder

	- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00040851.1991.12002839 
However, a greater range of albedo values can be found
in the urbanized area (Boulder) with values between 0.16 and 0.27. (1991)
